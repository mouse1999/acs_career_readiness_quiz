Hi Eric,
I recently started at BloomTech and I'm currently progressing through the Backend Development program. While researching BloomTech alumni, I came across your profile and was inspired by your journey, especially how you transitioned from studying Electrical Engineering to becoming a Software Developer at Amazon.
Right now, Iâ€™m looking for advice on how to set myself apart in the tech industry as I approach the job search phase. Would you be open to connecting for a 20-minute chat? I'd love to hear more about your experience working at Amazon and any insights you could share from your own path.
Feel free to grab a time that works for you on my Calendly: https://calendly.com/kufreedward26/20-minute-meeting.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Best regards,
Kufre Edward
